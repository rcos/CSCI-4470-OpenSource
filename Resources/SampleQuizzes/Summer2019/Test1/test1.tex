We have a new paragraph. Extend it to wrap as well. Below is a picture of a pelican.

\item Consider the following scenario. You are working in a ``blessed'' repository configuration. On your laptop you have a clone of your fork with two remotes set up. The remote \textbf{origin} points to your forked repository and \textbf{upstream} points to the blessed repositiory. 
All three repositories are out of synch. You can assume the blessed repository \textit{(upstream)} has:
\begin{itemize} \item a new file ``d.cxx'' \end{itemize} 
and your fork \textit{(origin)} has: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item a new file ``e.cxx''.
\end{itemize} 
Your local repository on your laptop has 
\begin{itemize}
	\item a new file named ``a.cxx'' and \item two modified  files ``b.cxx'' and ``c.cxx''.
\end{itemize} 
Your goal is to get all of these changes in the master branch in your fork \textit{(origin)} so you can make a pull request to the blessed repository. Give the sequence of git commands required to reach the state where all changes are present in your fork and you are ready for the pull request. (15 pts)

Write your git commands below

\beginanswers
\begin{lstlisting}
git add a.cxx
git add -u
git commit -m "Committing the local changes"
git pull origin master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master

clean:
	rm *.o *.so hi1 hi2
\end{lstlisting}
	\else
	\hspace*{-0.4in}\framebox(540,200){}

	\item Now turn the Makefile into a CMakeLists.txt file. Add the commands to generate an install target to install ``m1'' and ``m2'' into ``bin'' and the shared library into ``lib'' (10 pts):
	
			\beginanswers
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=make]

	project(Hello C)
	
	add_library(b SHARED b.c)
