**It's important to keep working on your final projects so that you do not fall behind. This project represents a large portion of your final grade
and you will learn many useful skills from working on it. Do not be afraid to ask for help if you are having problems/struggling.
We all want you to succeed and do well so do not hesitate to ask a mentor or Professor Turner for help!**
