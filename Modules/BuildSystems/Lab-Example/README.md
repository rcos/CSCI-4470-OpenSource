This is the code for the build systems module lab. the `source` directory
contains the source code for the libraries. In this directory, you need to 
create a Makefile and a `CMakelists.txt` file. The `headers` directory contains
the library header file. The `build` directory can be used with 
`cmake` to do an `out of source` build.
