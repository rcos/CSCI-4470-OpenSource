Why Open Source?
=====================

Open Source Issues
------------------

- Why Open Source?
- Why not Open Source?
- Difference between Open Source and Free Software

Why Open Source?
----------------

.. rst-class:: build

- Fun

  - Form Communities
  - Engage in a hobby
  - Learning Experience

- Profitable and Successful Business Models
  
  - `Red Hat, Inc. <https://www.redhat.com/en>`_

   - `Cygnus Solutions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions>`_

  - `Kitware <https://kitware.com>`_
  - Service Oriented Business Model

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Altruism 
  – serve the planet – If the world improves, you improve

- Open Science and Engineering
  
  - Open – Access to Data
  - Open – Access to Source Code
  - Collaboration oriented

- Intellectual Freedom
  
  - Idea is a property – if and when an idea gets patented, you no longer have the freedom to use it

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Open Medicine
  
  - Data
  - Chemical Compounds
  - Effectiveness of Treatment

- Scalable Software Development 

  - Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and The Bazaar

    - “Open source peer review is the only scalable method for achieving high reliability and quality”

Why Not Open Source?
--------------------

.. rst-class:: build

- Intellectual property concerns
- Chaotic development environment

  - Volunteer based
  - Distributed
  - No clear authority

- Hard to change code
  
  - Public API visible
  - Internal structure visible

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Benefits are a function of community size

- Proprietary business model

  - Better understood
  - Greater potential for $$$

The Open Source Model
=====================

The Cathedral and the Bazaar
----------------------------

- Cathedral Model (commercial world)

  - Development by a single person or by a chosen committee

- Bazaar Model (linux world)

  - Contribution by people – but used in alpha, pre alpha stage by a lot of people – Release early and release often

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Every Good Work of Software starts by scratching a developer's itch. - Most students projects tend to be on games!
- Good Programmers know what to write; Great ones know what to rewrite and reuse!
- Plan to throw one away; you will anyhow (Fred Brooks, “The Mythical Man Month”)

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that interests you.
- If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you (be part of a community)
- Release early, Release often. And listen to your customers.
- Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
- When you lose interest in a program, your last duty is to hand off to a competent successor.

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone
- Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
- If you treat your beta testers as if they are your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
- When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, `syntactic sugar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar>`_ can be your friend.

Software Management Functions
-----------------------------

Software Management has five functions.

.. rst-class:: build

1. Define goals and keep every one pointed in the same direction.
#. To Monitor and make sure critical details do not get skipped.
#. To motivate people to do boring and drudgery work.
#. To organize the deployment of people for best productivity.
#. To marshal resources needed to sustain the project.

Getting Started
===============

Establishing An Open Source Project
-----------------------------------

.. rst-class:: build

- Create a clear vision (requirements doc) – Technical domain, Software Stack/Tools
- Involve team oriented people (big egos are big problems)
- Identify leadership/management structure (Methods to break conflicts)
- Establish an effective software process
- Define Communication protocol

  - Chat room
  - Developer mailing list
  - Periodic face-to-face meetings

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build

- Avoid Pitfalls 
  
  - Establish Core architecture early
  - Start development with a few key people
  - Start testing early
  - Use version control
  - Lock up language.

Use External Tools
------------------

- Use external open source tools and libraries
- Redevelopment is a waste of time (most of the time)

Licensing
---------

- Understand licensing and use a license
- Select the software libraries that use similar (compatible) licenses
- Think about a commercialization strategy

  - Pure support
  - Open toolkits but closed applications
  - Open standards closed implementations
  - Open platforms/closed plug-ins)
