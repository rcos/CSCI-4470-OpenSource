A (Very) Brief History of Linux
===============================

The Main Characters
-------------------

- East Coast (MIT) Richard Stallman launched the GNU project – under GNU General Public License (GPL) - Stallman's manifesto:

  - Stated that availability of source code and freedom to redistribute and modify software are fundamental rights. 

- West Coast (UC Berkeley) was improving the UNIX system BSD Unix – supported by DARPA
  
More from the West Coast
------------------------

- BSD Unix released under BSD License. Kernel requires AT & T Unix license – hence remained proprietary.
- Another important Open Source Project is TeX (a typesetting system by Donald Knuth - Stanford)
- Communities for all of them exist even today

Communities
-----------

- USENET newsgroups and communities formed.
- They were able to patch programs and development was possible,
- X windows (Open Source) funded by consortium of companies.

UNIX Kernel
-----------

- Bill Jolitz (UCB) was developing kernel for i386 under Net/2 (free of the copyright form AT&T) – 386 BSD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jolitz
- Linus Torvalds (Finland) – unhappy with Prof. Tannenbaum's minix kernel was implementing linux kernel with GNU software. 
- 386 BSD evolved into NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
- Linux Kernel evolved into many GNU/Linux distributions (Slakware, Debian, Red Hat and many more)

More High Quality  Open Source Development
------------------------------------------

- Apache (Widely used WWW server)
- Perl, (an interpreted language with lots of libraries – bio-informatics)
- R (origin in AT&T Used by Statisticians and Data Analysts)
- Mozilla/Firefox – WWW Browser (origin Netscape)
- GNOME/KDE – Desktop Environment – Used for nonspecialists

More ... 
--------

- Python, Java, GO – Programming Languages 
- Open Data
- Open Research – Making the data and computations Public
