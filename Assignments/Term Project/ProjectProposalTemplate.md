Project Unk
===========
[https://github.com/wdturner/unk](https://github.com/wdturner/unk)

Overview
--------
The **UNK** project is a code representation of the unknown. This project will seek to encapsulate in code the complete knowledge of what we don't know and don't care about. We believe that by encapsulating everything we don't know and then systematically removing lines of code, we will make what is unknown smaller and by extension increase what is known.

This will be a systematic exploration. We will start by manually encoding some unknowns by ourselves and use this as a template for crowdsourcing to extend this data.

Once we reach a critical mass of unknowing, we will begin removing some of the unknown code from the repository to enable us to begin knowing more. One of the expected side effects is that this process will reveal some things we didn't know we didn't know and help us to complete the survey of the unknown.

Semester Plan
-------------
Obviously, capturing all that is unknown by everyone is a monumental task that will take at least 2 semesters. For this semester we will concentrate on just capturing something that is unknown by seven random strangers we have yet to meet. This will be coded into our project. We will use the process of unknowing capture and encoding to help us build a website that we can use to crowdsource more unknowns. Our semester goal is to have a beta version of the unknown website ready to preliminary testing so that we are on schedule to launch the full website next semester.

Technology
----------
Since this is an unknown project, we are not completely sure what technology stack we will be using. We expect to use the **APL** programming language, or perhaps **x86 assembler** given their high unknowability.

Milestones
----------
Milestones are given as weeks from project start:

- By Week 1 : Investigate the **Unknown** language options and choose one best suited to encapsulate what we don't know.
- By Week 4 : Obtain unknown information on 6 things that 6 random strangers don't know.
- By Week 7 : Have the informaton from the last stranger. We assume that strangers who don't know things will become harder to find once more people know what we are doing.
- By Week 9: Have the seven unknowns coded into the chosen (unknown) language.
- By Week 10 : Completely develop the website that uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to source a cooperative crowd, decide what they don't know and automatically encode it into the chosen laguage.
